# USTH Web crawler - GROUP 5

## Introduction
Our project is about developing a website to monitor X-ray images of the Covid-19 using a method called web crawler. This project was made suitable for 2 browsers which are FireFox and Google Chrome. Our images and data are from a respectable source which is SIRM(which stands for Società Italiana di Radiologia Medica e Interventistica).  We hope to provide extra details to raise awareness about the global pandemic.
